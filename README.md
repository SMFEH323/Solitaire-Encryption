# Solitaire-Encryption
 
## Description
The Solitaire Encryption System is a Java-based implementation of the Solitaire cryptographic algorithm, which uses a deck of playing cards to generate a pseudorandom keystream for encryption and decryption of messages. This project includes classes for managing the deck, generating keystream values, and encoding or decoding text based on Bruce Schneier's description of the algorithm.

## Installation
To install this project, clone the repository using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/SMFEH323/solitaire-encryption.git
```
Then, navigate to the directory containing the project files.

## Usage
To use the Solitaire Encryption System, compile the Java files and run the `SolitaireMain.java` to start the program. The system will prompt you for input to either encode or decode a message using the algorithm.

Compile the files using:
```
javac *.java
```
Run the main program with:
```
java SolitaireMain
```
